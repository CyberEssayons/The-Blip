Theme: aberation..abberation?...aberration?...abberration? abnegation? apple?

looked it up: aberation

thoughts: 
has to be small scope
 - each item the player picks up works differently than expected
 - Horror, but the enemy is literally a temporal aberation
 - gun that Alives people
 - horror where it's the player's parent blipping (bliping?) in and out of existence...
 
Kinda like the last one. Might be too big. We'll see. 

What's needed: 
	- build room(s)
		-cheat building and just download a mesh?
			-technically not cheating
			-also really have to make a GitHub...
	- create parent (mom? dad?, Dad-mom? MOM-DAD? BatDad? BatMom?)
	- gather sounds: 
		-bliping noise
		-static for tv
		-electrostatic? is that even a real word?
		-light switch
		-disembodied voice
		-footsteps? Maybe
		-voice acting? Probably at this point, but just for parent
		-music?
			-probably somber for lead in
			-then high energy for when blips start
	- determine scare trajectory
		- initial non scare build up
			- Send player to front door to lock it
			- turn on lights in another room
			- turn on TV
			- play tense music on the way
			- turn off TV
			- be normal
		- secondary non scare build up
			-Send player to bed room from TV
			-Hear disembodied voice from down the hall
			- play tense music again, increase volume as player gets closer
			- cut the music right before the player reaches location
			- nothing.jpg
		- first blip (kinda a jump scare)
			- No build up for this, just send player to bedroom
			- blip when they pass the door way
		- build up
			- electro-static playing globally
			- tense music starts to ramp again
			- direct player to basement or bathroom - It's bathroom...we don't have a basement
			- Suddenly stop - use a timer with some arbitrary or random time
		- Final blip
			- Direct player to go outside
			- player reaches front door
			- blip 
			- "Son!" distorted shout
			- end game with player character saying "Dad?..."
			
Day one log: 
	- Found mesh assets to cheese the level making process
	- created terrain
	- cried only a little
	- created a player
	- implemented simple world controls
	- half built the house
	- Made animations for some of the appliances
	- Made a lot of Prof. Oak jokes to myself
	- Cringed at own jokes
Day Two log (late):
	- Got a lot of meshes converted to glb from fbx at once 
	- Used the TV mesh
	- "learned" how to use SubViewports to play 2D video in 3D (a.k.a mortal struggle mixed with sudden unexpected success...somehow)
	- Got git lfs installed because the video file was too big
	- Started in on actual game logic (Thought I was going to lay out the area first but realized I HAVE to have a game at the end, so prototype it is)


Day Three (not late):
	- Added stove and fridge
	- Added some basic game logic
	- Added playerhit so players will know what to do
	- Allowed for multi use of front door stuff
	- Need to figure out how to work doors once at that point...

Day Four (oops): 
	- Nothing lol...

Day Five:
	- started work on the doors
	- Utterly failed at making doors
	- Continued to fail at making a video of this
	- Should really be screen recording...
Day Six:
	- Got doors to actually work
	- Placed doors
	- Placed the walls again for the 5,000,000th time
